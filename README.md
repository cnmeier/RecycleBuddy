## Premise
We have found ourselves wondering on a daily basis what the best way to dispose of something is. Our idea was for someone to be able to log into our application (backed by MongoDB Atlas) where they could search for any item and be told how to dispose of the item: by composting, recycling, or trashing. At this stage, a user can search for any food item and the results dynamically appear on the screen. This data comes from the USDA's FoodData Central API. We were planning to also use the Earth911 to determine the best way to dispose of the product but unfortunatly never got a response with an API key. Despite this, we were able to learn and accomplish a lot in this 36 hours.
